# Protein Simulation
Hands on introduction to protein simulation using NAMD.
The data files correspond to an example simulation of the human ubiquitin protein (PDB code: 1UBQ) generated from experimental data.
This example is related (but not equal) to the [official NAMD tutorial](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd-index.html).
It is also similar to the example tutorial recently proposed for [GROMACS](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.4c04901) in the context of [BioExcel tutorials](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.4c04901#:~:text=https%3A//gromacs.bioexcel.eu/).
