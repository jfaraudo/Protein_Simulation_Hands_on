Examples of movies showing results from published MD simulations involving proteins:

- Testing the binding of drug molecule candidates to a protein mutant involved in several cancer types (se paper [here](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/nr/d3nr04513g))
- Interaction of proteins with a nanoparticle and formation of a protein corona ([here](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/nr/c6nr01732k) and [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsabm.9b00386)).
